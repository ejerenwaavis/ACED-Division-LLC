        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Data Encryption:</strong> We use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption to protect the
            transmission of credit card information. Your payment details are encrypted before being
            transmitted over the internet.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Limited Access:</strong> We restrict access to your personal information to authorized
            employees and service providers who need it to process your payment or provide other essential services.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Payment Processor:</strong> We use reputable third-party payment processors
            who are compliant with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI DSS).
            These processors securely handle all credit card transactions. We do <em>not</em> store or
            have access to your full credit card number unless it is necessary for recurring or subscription
            payments, and in those cases, the data is handled according to PCI DSS.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Data Retention:</strong> We retain personal information for as long as necessary to
            fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period
            is required or permitted by law.
